    <h1>Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls</h1>
    <h2>Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. 
      There has been progress over the last decades: More girls are going to school, fewer girls are forced into early marriage, more women are serving in parliament and positions of leadership, and laws are being reformed to advance gender equality. 
      Despite these gains, many challenges remain: discriminatory laws and social norms remain pervasive, women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership, and 1 in 5 women and girls between the ages of 15 and 49 report experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner within a 12-month period.
